      <description>InequaliTalks
&amp;ldquo;InequaliTalks presents accessible research done by young economists on one of the most pressing issues in the public conversation: inequality.&amp;rdquo;
For our project, it is particularly relevant in terms of econometric methods and the topic of economic inequality. cf. Episode 7 on Wealth Inequality and Housing with Clara Martínez-Toledano and Episode 5 on Global Land Inequality with Yajna Govind.

      <description>SEGUE @ ODISSEI Conference for Social Science in the Netherlands 2023 On November 13th and 14th, 2023, our team member, Bayi Li, participated in a teaching workshop on modelling and simulation. The workshop aimed to empower participants to explore and validate their agent-based models.
The workshop, led by a team of researchers with recognised expertise in interdisciplinary practices, provided step-by-step advanced methods for model exploration over the first two days. Prior to this, theoretical courses were conducted to explain what Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) is, its purpose, and the characteristics of a good model.</description>

      <description>SEGUE @ ODISSEI Conference for Social Science in the Netherlands 2023 This November, two of our members took part in the ODISSEI Conference for Social Science in the Netherlands 2023. This event aimed to unite a community of computational social scientists for discussions on topics such as data, methodologies, infrastructure, ethics, and theoretical aspects linked to the use of digital and computational techniques in social science research. ODISSEI, which serves as the research infrastructure for social science in the Netherlands, facilitates the connection of researchers with essential data, knowledge, and tools, enabling them to conduct innovative research and embrace the computational dimension in their social inquiries.</description>

      <title>Utility-based Decision Making</title>

      <description>Utility-based decision making is one of the most prominent theories applied in Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), especially in discrete choice modelling. In this webpost, Bayi Li describes two common extended utility theories.
Related terms Utility
Utility, in economics, refers to the satisfaction or benefit an individual receives from the consumption of goods or services (The Investopedia Team, 2022). Marshall (1890) broaden the definition that utility is the fulfilment or satisfaction of a desire, expanding the context to all possible motives to human action (Moscati, 2020).</description>

      <description>Symposium Synthetische Data Synthetic data simulate the joint characteristics of the relationships between people and objects (e.g. a school or a neighbourhood), thus allowing the simulation of reality without identifying the person or object. Synthetic data can be generated by an algorithm or a computer simulation. The advantage of synthetic data is that, depending on the purpose of the user, a trade-off is made between the analytical value of the dataset and the disclosure risk</description>

      <description>The “Ricos y pobres: ¿misma ciudad, distintos barrios?” project is an online tool that visually shows the evolution of urban economic segregation in more than 2000 municipalities of Spain. Using income data per census tract from the Spanish Statistical Agency, the extent of segregation among the richest and poorest groups of all cities of the country with available information were calculated for the 2015-2020 period. This tool allows the user to check the segregation levels of their municipality of choice through a set of maps, graphs and automatically-generated summary reports.</description>
