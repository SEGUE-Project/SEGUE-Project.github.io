      <description>Utility-based decision making is one of the most prominent theories applied in Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), especially in discrete choice modelling. In this webpost, Bayi Li describes two common extended utility theories.
Related terms Utility
Utility, in economics, refers to the satisfaction or benefit an individual receives from the consumption of goods or services (The Investopedia Team, 2022). Marshall (1890) broaden the definition that utility is the fulfilment or satisfaction of a desire, expanding the context to all possible motives to human action (Moscati, 2020).</description>

      <description>The “Ricos y pobres: ¿misma ciudad, distintos barrios?” project is an online tool that visually shows the evolution of urban economic segregation in more than 2000 municipalities of Spain. Using income data per census tract from the Spanish Statistical Agency, the extent of segregation among the richest and poorest groups of all cities of the country with available information were calculated for the 2015-2020 period. This tool allows the user to check the segregation levels of their municipality of choice through a set of maps, graphs and automatically-generated summary reports.</description>
