      <description>SEGUE @ ODISSEI Conference for Social Science in the Netherlands 2023 On November 13th and 14th, 2023, our team member, Bayi Li, participated in a teaching workshop on modelling and simulation. The workshop aimed to empower participants to explore and validate their agent-based models.
The workshop, led by a team of researchers with recognised expertise in interdisciplinary practices, provided step-by-step advanced methods for model exploration over the first two days. Prior to this, theoretical courses were conducted to explain what Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) is, its purpose, and the characteristics of a good model.</description>

      <description>SEGUE @ ODISSEI Conference for Social Science in the Netherlands 2023 This November, two of our members took part in the ODISSEI Conference for Social Science in the Netherlands 2023. This event aimed to unite a community of computational social scientists for discussions on topics such as data, methodologies, infrastructure, ethics, and theoretical aspects linked to the use of digital and computational techniques in social science research. ODISSEI, which serves as the research infrastructure for social science in the Netherlands, facilitates the connection of researchers with essential data, knowledge, and tools, enabling them to conduct innovative research and embrace the computational dimension in their social inquiries.</description>

      <description>SEGUE @ European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative Geography 2023 ECTQG’23 will take place in Braga (Portugal) between 14 and 17 September 2023, being organized by CITTA – the Research Centre for Territory, Transport and Environment of the Universities of Coimbra and Porto (https://citta.fe.up.pt/). It will be the 23rd edition of a prestigious conference series initiated in 1978 within which a wide variety of themes is addressed, such as epistemology and theory, geographic information science, geo-visualisation, spatial statistics, spatial interactions, networks, big geo-data, agent-based models, computer simulations, artificial life and intelligence, time geography, geo-history/archaeology, urban patterns and growth, fractals, scaling laws, economic geography, environmental and social sustainability, climate change, health geography, and transport and land use</description>

      <description>Symposium Synthetische Data Synthetic data simulate the joint characteristics of the relationships between people and objects (e.g. a school or a neighbourhood), thus allowing the simulation of reality without identifying the person or object. Synthetic data can be generated by an algorithm or a computer simulation. The advantage of synthetic data is that, depending on the purpose of the user, a trade-off is made between the analytical value of the dataset and the disclosure risk</description>
